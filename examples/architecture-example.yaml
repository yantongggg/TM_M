# EXAMPLE: Architecture description for YOUR system
# ============================================================================
#
# Copy this file to your repository as 'architecture.yaml' and customize it
# to describe YOUR system's components, data flows, and trust boundaries.
#
# This is a simplified template - add as much detail as possible for better
# threat modeling results.
#
# ============================================================================

system:
  name: "Your System Name"
  description: "Brief description of what your system does"
  version: "1.0.0"

# List all components in your system
components:
  - name: "Web Frontend"
    type: "Web Application"
    technology: "React.js / Vue / Angular"
    description: "Your frontend application description"
    exposed: true              # Is this accessible from the internet?
    trust_zone: "Internet"     # Internet, DMZ, Private Network, etc.

  - name: "API Service"
    type: "API"
    technology: "Python / Node.js / Go"
    description: "Your backend API description"
    exposed: false
    trust_zone: "Private Network"
    database: "PostgreSQL / MySQL / MongoDB"

  - name: "Database"
    type: "Database"
    technology: "PostgreSQL"
    description: "Your database description"
    exposed: false
    trust_zone: "Private Network"
    encryption_at_rest: true
    encryption_in_transit: true

# Describe how data flows between components
data_flows:
  - source: "Web Frontend"
    destination: "API Service"
    protocol: "HTTPS"
    data_type: "User requests, authentication tokens"
    authentication: "JWT / OAuth / API Key"

  - source: "API Service"
    destination: "Database"
    protocol: "PostgreSQL over TLS"
    data_type: "Query results, user data"
    authentication: "Username/Password"

# Describe trust boundaries and security controls
trust_boundaries:
  - name: "Internet to Private Network"
    type: "Network Boundary"
    description: "Boundary between public internet and private services"
    controls:
      - "Load Balancer"
      - "Web Application Firewall (WAF)"
      - "API Gateway"

# Security context and compliance requirements
security_context:
  compliance_requirements:
    - "SOC 2"
    - "GDPR"
    # Add: PCI DSS, HIPAA, ISO 27001, etc.

  threat_modeling_scope:
    - "Web application security"
    - "API security"
    - "Data protection"
    # Add other relevant scopes

  assumptions:
    - "Services run in a VPC"
    - "Secrets stored in vault"
    - "Logging and monitoring enabled"
    # Add other assumptions about your infrastructure

# ============================================================================
# TIPS FOR BETTER THREAT MODELING:
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. BE SPECIFIC:
#    - Include actual technologies and versions
#    - Specify authentication methods
#    - List external dependencies
#
# 2. ADD MORE COMPONENTS:
#    - Caches (Redis, Memcached)
#    - Message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka)
#    - Third-party APIs
#    - Storage (S3, Azure Blob)
#    - CDN services
#
# 3. DESCRIBE DATA FLOWS:
#    - What data is being transmitted?
#    - Is it sensitive (PII, PCI, PHI)?
#    - What protocol is used?
#    - How is authentication handled?
#
# 4. IDENTIFY TRUST BOUNDARIES:
#    - Internet → DMZ
#    - DMZ → Private Network
#    - Application → Database
#    - On-premise → Cloud
#
# 5. INCLUDE SECURITY CONTROLS:
#    - Existing security measures
#    - Encryption settings
#    - Access controls
#    - Monitoring/logging
